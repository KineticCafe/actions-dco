# Contributing

Contribution to KineticCafe/actions-dco is encouraged: bug reports, feature
requests, or code contributions. New features should be proposed and discussed
in an [issue][issues].

Before contributing patches, please read the [Licence](./LICENCE.md).

This action is governed under the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][cccoc].

## Code Guidelines

I have several guidelines to contributing code through pull requests:

- I use [pinact][pinact] and [zizmor][zizmor] to ensure that the action uses
  up-to-date dependencies as required.

- Proposed changes should be on a thoughtfully-named topic branch and organized
  into logical commit chunks as appropriate.

- Use [Conventional Commits][conventional] with my
  [conventions](#commit-conventions).

- Documentation should be added or updated as appropriate for new or updated
  functionality.

- New dependencies are discouraged and their addition must be discussed,
  regardless whether it is a development dependency, optional dependency, or
  runtime dependency.

- All GitHub Actions checks marked as required must pass before a pull request
  may be accepted and merged.

## AI Contribution Policy

Contributions must be well understood by the submitter and that the developer
can attest to the [Developer Certificate of Origin][dco] for each pull request
(see [LICENCE](LICENCE.md)).

Any contribution (bug, feature request, or pull request) that uses undeclared AI
output will be rejected.

## Commit Conventions

I have adopted a variation of the Conventional Commits format for commit
messages. The following types are permitted:

| Type    | Purpose                                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`  | A new feature                                         |
| `fix`   | A bug fix                                             |
| `chore` | A code change that is neither a bug fix nor a feature |
| `docs`  | Documentation updates                                 |
| `deps`  | Dependency updates, including GitHub Actions.         |

I encourage the use of [Tim Pope's][tpope-qcm] or [Chris Beam's][cbeams]
guidelines on the writing of commit messages

I require the use of [git][trailers1] [trailers][trailers2] for specific
additional metadata and strongly encourage it for others. The conditionally
required metadata trailers are:

- `Breaking-Change`: if the change is a breaking change. **Do not** use the
  shorthand form (`feat!(scope)`) or `BREAKING CHANGE`.

- `Signed-off-by`: this is required for all developers except me, as outlined in
  the [Licence](./LICENCE.md#developer-certificate-of-origin).

- `Fixes` or `Resolves`: If a change fixes one or more open [issues][issues],
  that issue must be included in the `Fixes` or `Resolves` trailer. Multiple
  issues should be listed comma separated in the same trailer:
  `Fixes: #1, #5, #7`, but _may_ appear in separate trailers. While both `Fixes`
  and `Resolves` are synonyms, only _one_ should be used in a given commit or
  pull request.

- `Related to`: If a change does not fix an issue, those issue references should
  be included in this trailer.
