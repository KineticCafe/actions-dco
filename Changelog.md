# KineticCafe/actions-dco Changelog

## 1.3.6 / 2025-08-17

- Upgrade dependencies.

- Added debug logs to try to debug [#169][issue-169].

- Change `gitSignoffs` to use `String.prototype.matchAll()` instead of
  `Regexp.prototype.exec()`, and to use named capture groups. While I don't
  expect this to fix [#169][issue-169] based on the example data provided, it
  should result in improved pattern matching across multiple commits.
